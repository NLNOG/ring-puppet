SMOKEPING PUPPET MODULE

Smokeping is a nifty tool that keeps track of network latency and does
awesome visualisation. Please visit the smokeping website for more
information: http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping

This puppet module helps to setup a smokeping master/slave setup and create
a full mesh of nodes tracking latency towards each other. This means that
every node you make smokeping::slave will be both a Target and a Slave. 

To use this module, follow these directions:

Warning: i've only tested this module on ubuntu 10.10

1. Install the "common" module -- the smokeping module depends on functions
    that are defined and installed via the common module, see README.common
    for how to do this.

2. You will need storedconfigs enabled in your puppet setup, to do that you
    need to add a line to your puppet.conf in your [puppetmasterd] section
    which says:
   
    storeconfigs=true

    You may wish to immediately setup a mysql/pgsql database for your 
    storedconfigs, as the default method uses sqlite, and is not very 
    efficient, to do that you need lines such as the following below the 
    storeconfigs=true line (adjust as needed):

    dbadapter=mysql
    dbserver=localhost
    dbuser=puppet
    dbpassword=puppetspasswd

3. Install the 'smokeping' module:
    a. Your modules directory will need all the files included in this 
       repository placed under a directory called "smokeping".

    b. add the following line to your modules.pp:
        
       import "smokeping"

       (NOTE: if you have followed the directions in README.common then
       you will have import "modules.pp" in your site.pp, if you do not
       have that, then you will need to add the import line to your
       site.pp)a

    c. maybe need to configure some stuff here regarding who teh master is

    d. In the node definition in your site.pp for your smokeping master add
       the following:

       $sp_owner = "Job Snijders"
       $sp_owner_email = "job@snijders-it.nl"
       $sp_cgi_url = "http://master01.ring.nlnog.net/smokeping/smokeping.cgi"
       $sp_mailhost = "smtp.ring.nlnog.net"
       include smokeping::master

    e. On each node that will run as a smokeping slave add this line to the
       node's entry in site.pp.
        
       include smokeping::slave

    f. In modules/smokeping/files/default-smokeping you should change the
       MASTER_URL to the same url as the above defined $sp_cgi_url

4. Cleanup: If you need any manual configuration or had already nodes
    defined in your smokeping config, you can add/remove them from
    /etc/smokeping/targets.conf on the smokeping::master
