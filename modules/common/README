Common Module
-------------

The common module installs various functions that are required by other
modules. This module should be installed before any of the other module.

! Upgrade Notice !

The 'append_if_no_such_line' define has been replaced with the 'line' define. If
you are using 'append_if_no_such_line' anywhere in your manifests, you will need
to transition to 'line' before upgrading to this version of the common
module. The 'line' define is a drop-in replacement and essentially equivalent,
so the transition is quite easy, you should only simply need to change the name
in your manifests.

To use this module, follow these directions:

1. Your modules directory will need all the files included in this
   repository placed under a directory called "common"

2. Add the following line to manifests/site.pp:
   
       import "modules.pp"

3. Add the following line to manifests/modules.pp:

       import "common"
