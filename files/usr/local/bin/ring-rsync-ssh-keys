This script is deprecated, please follow these instructions: 

To manage your ssh keys: 

    - place all public components of ssh keys from your co-workers on your own machine in the following file: ~/ssh-keys
    - the file format of ssh-keys is the same as regular authorized_keys files
    - notify a ring admin (ring-admins@ring.nlnog.net) that you have performed changes. 
    - the admin will add new keys or remove old ones that are no longer present in ~/ssh-keys in the management system
    - the changes will be propagated to all current machines

# old script:

then
    echo -e "No arguments were given\n
    Usuage: `basename $0` all 
    This script will rsync the contents of ~/.ssh/ from this server to all ring servers
    Keep the following things in mind:
        - puppet will ensure that the ssh key you gave to the ring-admins is always present on all servers
        - you are responsible for the additional keys that are synced to all servers through this script
        - only add keys of your co-workers
        - this script will overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file on all other servers
